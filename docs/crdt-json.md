# CRDTJson Module

```python
# CRDTJson.py
# A Conflict-Free Replicated Data Type (CRDT) implemented as a JSON-like object
# This module provides a CRDTJson class for creating JSON-like objects that can be merged without conflicts
```

## Usage

- `CRDTJson()` : Initializes a new CRDTJson instance.
- `set(replaced_text, process_uuid)` : Registers a new key-value pair in the CRDTJson instance.
- `get(replaced_text)` : Retrieves the value associated with a given key in the CRDTJson instance.
- `merge(other)` : Merges the data from another CRDTJson instance into the current instance, resolving conflicts as necessary.


# Process Scripts

```python
# Process1.py, Process2.py, Process3.py
# Independent processes that create CRDTJson instances and populate them with key-value pairs
# Each process script generates a CRDTJson instance and writes its data to a separate JSON file
```

## Usage

- Run each process script independently to simulate concurrent processes.


# Merge Script

```python
# MergeScript.py
# A script to merge JSON-like data from multiple CRDTJson instances into a single, coherent JSON object
# This script reads data from separate JSON files generated by concurrent processes,
# creates CRDTJson instances from this data, and merges these instances.
```

## Usage

- `load_json_to_crdt(filename)` : Loads JSON data from a given file and initializes a new CRDTJson instance with this data.
- Run this script after the Process scripts to merge their outputs into a single, coherent JSON object.
- The final merged data can be saved to a new JSON file, if desired.
