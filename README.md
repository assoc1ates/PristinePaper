# PristinePaper

## Description
PristinePaper is an aspirational auto-anonymization and de-anonymization layer designed to protect the privacy of your documents. This tool aims to achieve 99.99% precision in scrubbing and restoring documents, effectively acting as a privacy shield for users leveraging Language Models (LLMs) and other API endpoints.

## Goals
1. **Preserve Privacy**: Ensure that user data remains private and secure during interactions with LLMs or any external APIs.
2. **High Precision**: Target a 99.99% precision rate in the anonymization and de-anonymization processes.
3. **Integration Ready**: Aspire to develop as a standalone tool, but with easy integration points for existing projects, such as Khoj and FileBot.
4. **User Friendly**: Aim to create an easy-to-use Python library that requires minimal setup and configuration.

## Aspirational Features
- Automatic detection and anonymization of sensitive information in documents
- Secure and precise de-anonymization for authorized use cases
- Transparent operation, allowing users to understand what data is being anonymized
- Customizable anonymization patterns based on user requirements

## Planned Installation Method
^^^bash
pip install pristinepaper
^^^

## Example Usage (Aspirational)
^^^python
from pristinepaper import Anonymizer

# Initialize the anonymizer
anonymizer = Anonymizer()

# Anonymize a document
anonymized_doc = anonymizer.anonymize("sample_document.txt")

# De-anonymize a document
original_doc = anonymizer.deanonymize(anonymized_doc)
^^^
